A toy lisp written in ocaml.

This is unlikely to be of any use to anyone, and is created entirely for my own edification.

Done:

* Basic types
* Eval
* Naive reader
* Print
* List basics
* Interpret source files

Todo:

* Macros
* Tail recursion
* Real reader
* Read macros
* Standard library
* Files, sockets etc
* Better error handling and reporting
* Optimisations
* Native interop
* ....
